Displays scroll bars with the scrolling capability. Can be configured with the following options:

Background: If you want to give the scroll viewbox a specific background, set it here.

Top and Bottom Offset: If the scrolling viewbox sits underneath headers and footers (so you can effectively scroll behind them), use this option to indicate the “viewable” scrolling area where the bar should appear.

Bar color, width, margin: Essentially gives you control over the look and feel of the scroll bar.

Autohide: Allows you to hide the bar by default, only visible when scrolling, or to always show the bar.
